Comparison Operators:

Comparison operators are used to compare two values (or variables). This is important in programming, because it helps us to find answers and make decisions.
The return value of a comparison is either 1 or 0, which means true (1) or false (0). These values are known as Boolean values, and you will learn more about them in the Booleans and If..Else chapter.
In the following example, we use the greater than operator (>) to find out if 5 is greater than 3:



Operator             Name 	                             Example 
== 	                Equal to 	                         x == y 	
!=              	Not equal 	                         x != y 	
> 	                Greater than                    	 x > y 	
< 	                Less than 	                         x < y 	
>= 	                Greater than or equal to 	         x >= y 	
<=              	Less than or equal to 	             x <= y
